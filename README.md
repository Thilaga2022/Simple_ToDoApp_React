# 📝 Todo List App (React)

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple yet functional Todo List app built using **React**. I created this as a hands-on project to brush up on React hooks like `useState` and to practice basic CRUD operations in a clean UI.

## 🚀 Features
- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- Real-time updates using React state
- Minimal and clean UI

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Handling form inputs in React
- Dynamically rendering lists with `.map()`
- Managing state using `useState`
- Passing props and handling events

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- React (with Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML/CSS
